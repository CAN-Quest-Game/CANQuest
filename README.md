# Welcome to CANQuest 🚗🛡️
CANQuest is an open-source, gamified platform designed to teach and raise awareness about automotive cybersecurity.
Built using Unreal Engine 5, it simulates real-world CAN bus vulnerabilities and challenges players to hack, protect, and explore virtual vehicles.

This repository is only one part of CANQuest — it contains the game itself.
To fully develop CANQuest, you will also need the **Server**, which connects to the game to communicate.
